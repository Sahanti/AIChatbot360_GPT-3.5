            "1. Begin by isolating the term with x on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 5 from both sides:\n",

            "   This simplifies to:\n",
            "   2x = 10\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Now, to solve for x, divide both sides by 2:\n",
            "   2x/2 = 10/2\n",
